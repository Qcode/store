	  I've removed the
	  buttons when there's one item in any of the saved, unavailable,

	  carts, but it's a simple to change to hide it in the case where
	  there are more

	  Why is it North-American-centric?
	  a) It has to be something since it is not practical to be

	  b) North-American-centric is broader than Canada-centric and
	  covers the majority of our clients.

	  in veseys in r11906, but since we keep a copy of the
	  sql in store, fix it here as well
	  - completely removed CatalogStatusAction, as it hasn't been used

	  - do the usual refactor and cleanup on Delete, Status and Edit -
	  note Edit is now an abstract class
