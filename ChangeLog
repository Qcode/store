	  "I hadn’t considered what I was doing with this code. When
	  comparing two objects
	  using the non-strict comparison operator (==) PHP compares all
	  the properties
	  of the objects and if they match the objects are deemed to be
	  equal. If they
	  don’t match they are not equal. In effect, we have a recursive
	  comparison of

	  when you only
	  have 1 item in your cart (or even when you only have 2 or 3)."
	  I've removed the
	  buttons when there's one item in any of the saved, unavailable,
	  or available
	  carts, but it's a simple to change to hide it in the case where
	  there are more

	* [r13073] store/trunk/Store/pages/StoreCheckoutBasicInfoPage.php:
	  Better message when you try to create an account with an email

	  though they didn't need to).

	  store/trunk/www/styles/store-total-row.css:
	  Added an optional note property to TotalRows. This is useful for
	  specifying

2006-11-14  nrf

	* [r13051]
	  store/trunk/Store/admin/components/Product/ImageEdit.php:
	  The first placeholder needs to be escaped (double %) since it is
	  used by SwatFormField to subsitute the field name into the
	  message. It could be double escaped AND numbered, but that's
	  not necessary since the second sprintf() only expects one
	  placeholder.
	* [r13050]

	  manages the account dataobject.

2006-11-14  isaac

	* [r13013]
	  store/trunk/Store/admin/components/ItemGroup/Delete.php:
	  follow mikes lead, which should of been obvious, and move the
	  surrounding html outside of the sprintf - when doing
	  this, I also noticed a sprintf placeholder that had been removed
	  in r12938 that is actually used a few lines below

2006-11-14  nrf

	* [r13012] store/trunk/Store/pages/StoreCheckoutPage.php,
	  store/trunk/Store/pages/StoreCheckoutThankYouPage.php:

	  - Remove special check for rare case of thank you page not
	  loading which will now be handled in the normal path.

	  move r12973 up to store, wish i'd noticed this before r13001
	* [r13002]
	  store/trunk/Store/admin/components/ItemGroup/Delete.php:
	  this was fixed up in r12938, but it was originally intended to
	  remove all html markup from the string, so hence this commit
	* [r13001]
	  store/trunk/Store/admin/components/Category/ChangeItemStatus.php,
	  store/trunk/Store/admin/components/Category/SetItemEnabled.php:
	  move r12947 to store where it belongs, and fix up steven's code
	  along the way.
	  
	  For future reference Steve, you don't need to wrap an ngettext
	  in a sprintf unless you have placeholders that need
	  replacing within the text

2006-11-14  nick

	* [r12957] store/trunk/Store/pages/StoreArticlePage.php:
	  get article in init phase and set selected article id with the
	  id of the page article. This likely breaks something.

	  this finishes moving the Catalog component up to Store, which
	  includes:
	  - adding another abstract method to the dataobject to get the
	  dataobjects constants based on a value passed in - this
	  allows us to do most status changes/displays in Store instead of
	  constantly needing to be subclassed
	  - updated the StatusCellRenderer so it works properly (see above)
	  - found a bug in the cascade deletes that has already been fixed
	  in veseys in r11906, but since we keep a copy of the
	  sql in store, fix it here as well
	  - completely removed CatalogStatusAction, as it hasn't been used
	  in ages - way back in r8418
	  - do the usual refactor and cleanup on Delete, Status and Edit -
	  note Edit is now an abstract class

	  the cart.
	  - Explicitly display the form instead of setting visible and
	  displaying the
	  whole UI.
	  - Don't check for hasMessages() when adding cart messages to the
	  page. The
	  foreach loop will never run if getMessages() returns an empty
	  array.
	* [r7735] store/trunk/Store/StoreCart.php:
	  Make adding messaged protected. Only the cart should be able to
	  add messages to

	  The getTotal() method needs both provstates.

	  This is still a bit rough, but both the Veseys frontend and the

	  heavily to work with the new Site package, its interface did not
	  change much so admin site code requires minimal changes to work.
	  
	  - Go upstream! Site package does more now.
	  - Remove duplicated functionality form Store and Admin packages.
	  - SiteLayout and subclasses are now responsible for the "site
	  trim".

	  too.
	  - Single point of page sub-classing from StorePage to VeseysPage
	  is gone allowing other base page subclasses in Store.
