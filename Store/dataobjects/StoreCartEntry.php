/**
 * An entry in a shopping cart for an e-commerce web application
 *
 * All cart specific item information is stored in this object. This includes
 * things like special finishes or engraving information that is not specific
 * to an item, but is specific to an item in a customer's shopping cart.
 *
 * For specific sites, this class must be subclassed to provide specific
 * features. For example, on a site supporting the engraving of items, a
 * subclass of this class could have a getEngravingCost() method.
 *
 * The StoreCart*View classes handle all the displaying of StoreCartEntry
 * objects. StoreCartEntry must provide sufficient toString() methods to allow
 * the StoreCart*View classes to display cart entries. Remember when
 * subclassing this class to add these toString() methods.
