 * Catalogs group products together into management units. Catalogs are not
 * typically visible in the frontend of a store. They often represent products
 * specific to an actual physical catalog.
 *
 * Every individual product belong to exactly one catalog.
 *
 * A catalog is available in a region if it has a region binding in the
 * CatalogRegionBinding table for the region. Products in unavailable
 * catalogs are not visible on the front-end.
 *
 * Orthogonal to availability, catalogs are in season or out of season
 * based on the in_season boolean.
 *
 * Catalogs can be cloned to create a 'working-copy' of contained products.
 * The cloned catalog can be swapped with the parent catalog when the product
 * changes are ready to go live.
