/**
 * An item for an e-commerce web application
 *
 * Items are the lowest level in the product structure. Each product can have
 * several items. For example, you could have a tee-shirt product and several
 * items under the product describing different sizes or colours.
 *
 * <pre>
 * Category
 * |
 * -- Product
 *    |
 *    -- Item
 * </pre>
 *
 * Creating StoreItem objects is necessary when the items are on the current
 * page and must be displayed. Some StoreItem objects are stored in the
 * customer's session because they are in the customer's cart.
 *
 * If there are many StoreItem objects that must be loaded for a page request,
 * the MDB2 wrapper class called StoreItemWrapper should be used to load the
 * objects.
 *
 * This class contains mostly data.
